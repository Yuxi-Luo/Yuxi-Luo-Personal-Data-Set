# Motivation:
Generative AI is currently being applied to creative fields, but AI art faces numerous ethical controversies. In Chinese Fandom, which I've been involved in for a long time, debates about AI fan art have been frequent. Through this project, I hope to understand the most common characteristics of AI fan art and its popularity, and to envision its potential position and development within the fandom in the future.
# Data source:
This dataset is a collection of data from the tag "ai绘画(ai drawings)" in Chinese fan platform Lofter. It is collected from the rankings of posts from March 2024 - April 2024. By analyzing this dataset, I hope to explore the relationship between the number of likes, recommendations, and comments received by AI fan art and independent variables such as style, illustration scale, affiliated fandom, and original work type of the fandom.
# Visualization:

The first bar plot is a visualization counting different styles. In the original dataset, style is a predictor defining the artistic style the AI fan art imnitating. From the visualization, we can see that ACGN style is the most popular among all the collected data, and the 3D Model, Water Color and Original Work Imnitating are the least welcomed. Impasto is the second popular one, and realistic is the third popular one. The ACGN style is closely related to ACGN culture, and this culture is very dominate in fandoms, and ACGN fandoms are the most flourished fandom in China; therefore, the popularity of ACGN style is propobably related to the popularity of ACGN culture in Chinese fandom.

This bar plot shows the relationship between Scale and Likes. Here, the “Scale” indicates in what size of character body the illustration draws. We can see that the Portrait scale is the most welcomed, and the Bust is the second. Comparing to larger scale, portrait and bust scale can more directly display facial features, and although it contains less information, it is very eye-catching. Small-scale illustrations also avoid errors that AI may make during the generation process. In addition, because AI art has lower information density and lacks emotional expression compared to human art, those who choose to support AI art may be more concerned with the direct visual impact than with the information in the illustration.

This visualization shows a linear regression relationship between the number of likes and recommendations. The visualization reveals a strong positive correlation between likes and recommendations, with Impasto-style viewers being most likely to provide a recommendation after a like. An extreme value in the upper right corner of the visualization influences the regression performance of ACGN style. Most works have low numbers of likes and recommendations, indicating that only a small number of works achieve high popularity.
